                <p style="text-indent: 0">You might find it offending, what I’m about to say. If that’s the case — good. I hope you’re truly and properly offended.</p>

<p>Each time we feel relieved that India has finally gotten over its liberal mindset fad, something happens that jolts us out of that mistaken belief.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://thewire.in/rights/lucknow-passport-officer-harasses-hindu-muslim-couple">this incident</a>, for example. An interfaith couple is scolded by an official in the passport office when he discovers that the names on their passports were not how he expected them to be. The Hindu woman, Tanvi Seth, was still using her maiden name, and the man, Mohammad Anas Siddiqui, still identified as Muslim. Unable to bear the cognitive dissonance, the official gave them both a piece of his mind. A <em>large</em> piece of his mind. But think, was his tirade really directed at the couple? I think not. I think the couple was merely a symptom — his angst was actually against the society we’ve become, a society <em>so</em> decadent that it not only allows two people of different religions to marry, but even lets a woman keep her own name after marriage, and her husband his own faith. I mean — seriously? Weren’t we <em>done</em> with being that open-minded already?</p>
<p>It’s obligatory that when a girl marries, she take on her husband’s family name. So why not Ms. Seth? What’s <em>she</em> trying to prove? That she has an independent identity even after marriage? That her husband’s family name isn’t good enough for her? Or that she doesn’t <em>belong</em> to her husband? I mean, there’s a whole <em>ritual</em> at the wedding to make this point — the giving away of the girl. <em>Giving</em> away, see? The girl is <em>given away</em>, gifted, transferred from her original owners, her parents, to her new owner, her husband. Accordingly, the stamp of her ownership, her family name, must also change from her parents’ to her husband’s, mustn’t it? <em>That</em>’s why she takes on <em>his</em> identity, <em>his</em> family name. Make sense? Good. So just blindly follow the edicts of your culture, and don’t question what men wiser than you have already established.</p>
<p>Girls have to be mindful of tradition, of custom, of family honour, of what other people will think of them. That’s why we teach them to be modest, well-behaved. Like, you know, how they must walk with their eyes lowered; cover every last <em>inch</em> of their bodies; not laugh loudly or immoderately; never smile at a <em>guy</em> <em>or</em> return his smile; and <em>certainly</em>, never, ever <em>touch</em> one, or — God forbid! — allow <em>him</em> to! Otherwise it’s a #MeToo story just waiting to happen. All guys are like that, even those purporting to be friends. <em>Especially</em> those purporting to be friends. Boys will be boys, we can let them get away with anything, but girls must do nothing that might violate our fragile, prudish cultural sensibilities.</p>
<p>Today’s girls are too uncaring about all that, far too forward, much too willful. Girls shouldn’t want to be <em>that</em> independent, to want to carry their own identities without a male custodian. They must be submissive and docile, self-deprecating — not talk themselves up, or <em>their</em> accomplishments, <em>their</em> ambitions. It’s very unbecoming. It makes the men feel diminished, intimidated — very bad for their egos. Men need to feel superior, to be in control, it’s a law of nature, you know.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, we <em>love</em> our girls, but they need to recognize the authority of the men — the <em>alpha</em> men — their fathers, their husbands, their mother’s second cousin’s brother-in-law, any male really — because <em>they</em> know what’s best for them. They know <em>better</em>. And haven’t we allowed them enough independence already? They can go to college, get advanced degrees, work in offices full of older guys with dubious intentions, even choose their own husbands. What do we get in return? Girls marrying outside their communities, outside their castes, outside their very religion. It’s scandalous, I tell you! Egalitarian!</p>
<p>This Tanvi Seth, she should know this — she grew <em>up</em> in this stifling environment. What’s she doing, flouting tradition, giving girls newfangled ideas about independent identities and all? She should know better.</p>
<p>Then there’s this man, this <em>Muslim</em> man, who doesn’t even change his <em>faith</em> after enticing that poor, gullible girl into marrying him outside of <em>hers</em>. He wouldn’t convert to his wife’s religion, the One and Only True Religion of India. Not even for the sake of his wife! I mean, a man must change his whole <em>life</em> just to keep the peace in the family, but this man wouldn’t even change his whole, entire religious <em>identity</em>? Everyone knows that after marriage the woman wears the pants in the house — and the man, well, the man is done for, isn’t he? Haven’t you seen those husband-wife memes forwarded on WhatsApp? How is a marriage supposed to work, if the man doesn’t agree with his wife one hundred percent? Why, my own cousin married a Muslim woman, and <em>he</em> didn’t change his religion either, but I’m <em>quite</em> sure that’s only because his wife told him not to. These interracial, interreligious marriages, they’re becoming much too common, makes it look like we’re a liberal people, people with a progressive mindset. Nonsense.</p>
<p>Look, what we really want is a conservative, orthodox, homogeneous society. Anachronistic. Just like, oh, I don’t know . . . <em>every country in the world</em>! Ignore the US and UK, they’re aberrations — look what <em>their</em> diversity got them. Racism. Xenophobia. Strife. We don’t want any of that — we can do those on our own, thank you very much. We just want a standard, male-dominated, one-faith-for-all, culturally pure society, untarnished by independent, insubordinate women and invading, usurping foreigners. Mr. Mishra, the passport officer, agrees, don’t you, Mr. Mishra?</p>
<p>Mr. Mishra is a card-carrying, chest-thumping member of our creed. Notice how, with his tirade, he so skillfully demonstrated the prejudices of our society? With his <em>own</em> example, no less, he showed not only how regressive we are, but also how much farther backwards we still have to go before we can have a utopian society as repressive and culturally stagnant as we want it to be. We need many more people like him if we are to thrust India truly and firmly into its glorious dark ages, a time when women were little more than cattle and there were no Muslims or other foreigners to sully our proud Aryan race. <em>That</em>’s where we really want to go — to the tenth century.</p>
<p>For his stellar services in exposing our misogyny and bigotry, our cultural superciliousness and narrow-mindedness, Mr. Mishra deserves a <em>medal</em>, don’t you think? Instead he’s being ridiculed, punished. How unfair.</p>
