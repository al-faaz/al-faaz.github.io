                <p style="text-indent: 0">I still remember the day I came into this family. It promised to be a good time &mdash; and it was. There was never a dull moment with me around. Guy and Gal loved me. I was their companion when they came home, weary from work everyday. I was there when they had their fights. I kept Gal company when Guy went away for almost two years, returning only on weekends, and Gal came back to an empty home everyday &mdash; except for me. I made her evenings cheerful.</p>

<p>I have seen strangers become friends, houses moved, love and laughter, fights and make-ups, and all the ups and downs of a full life. I have even seen two beautiful, wide-eyed children come into the family.</p>
<p>But I have grown old now. It's been twelve years since that first day in the family, and I am hearing talk about replacing me, getting a newer one of my kind. It's kind of scary, but I suppose everyone wants more verve, more youth, more life. I don’t begrudge Guy and Gal for wanting more.</p>
<p>I also have to admit, if I am honest with myself, that these youngsters do have a lot going for them. They can do things I could never do, even in my prime. They are bolder, smarter, classier than I ever was when I was younger. In time, I hope, they'll learn humility too, as age catches up with them, just as it has caught up with me. But despite my age, I’m still good for more. I can still light up a room, still give people the companionship they need. I am still bright and cheerful and agile, and I don't bother anyone. I've never even had health problems, such as that plague many of my age.</p>
<p>No, it isn't time for me to die &mdash; but that's what will happen if they just give me away. No one believes I can be of any use any more because I am too old &mdash; they just want the youngest and the most attractive ones. Youth and beauty are so seductive.</p>
<p>Guy and Gal understand. I can see it in their faces, hear it in their voices &mdash; they are hesitant to just give me away &mdash; they know I'll only be put to sleep. Surely the end must come one day, but for now, while I still have some good life remaining in me, I hope they find a good home to put me in &mdash; there must be someone out there who will be happy for the company, but can't afford one like me otherwise.</p>
<p>But I am not sure, and I’ll admit to being a little scared too. No one seems to like an old, boxy TV any more.</p>
